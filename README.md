# belly_button

## Overview
In this project, we use data on a group on individuals and the frequency of them washing their belly button
we want to have an idea on the amount of bacteria carried by not washing for a period of time.

## Results
using javscript, we create an interactive html to identify the individuals in the dataset, their 
frequency of washing their belly button and the bacteria they can host

## Summary
to create this website, https://pudens4.github.io/belly_button/, google and other people who worked on 
that similar project have been helpful
